Dumping leetcodes, hackerrank, and other trivial stuff in here to remember and practice data structures and algorithms

problems will be from Hackerrank and Leetcode

There should always be an input file, a main file, and a pdf with the problem.

-- so far only easy problems.
-- will write medium or hard next to the ones that are medium or hard problems. but so far I'm only at easy problems.
