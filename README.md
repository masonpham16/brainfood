Dumping leetcodes, hackerrank, and other trivial stuff in here to remember and practice data structures and algorithms

problems will be from Hackerrank and Leetcode

There should always be an input file, a main file, and a pdf with the problem.

So far only easy problems.
Will write medium or hard next to the ones that are medium or hard problems. but so far I'm only at easy problems.

-----May 23 2024
It seems like I'm going to stick with hackerrank for now until I have really mastered Python to a certain extend.
I'd also like to get to a decent rank to get some certs from that website.
I want to really be good good with my coding until I dive deeper into the more tricky stuff.
In the fall semester I will be a taking data structures and algorithm course, which will help me solve leetcode problems.
According to some experts leetcode will be easier whem I take more advanced CSC classes.

Currently using NVIM as my IDE. Haven't quite figured out how to use the python lsp yet, so there's really no autocompletion.
